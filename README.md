This is where I practice with Markdown.
=======================================

I'm taking a class on Python at Auburn University.  This is my repository for everything I'm doing in the class.

By making this repository I hope to learn about not only Python, but also Git and Github and, with this introductory file, Markdown.

I've written a lot of copy in all sorts of formats, including:
*	Scientific articles, mostly in ecology and evolutionary biology
*	Fiction, short and long
*	Nonfiction essays

Recently, I've been learning what makes writing for the *web* different.

I have a few goals for this course.
1. I want to learn Python, of course, and build a useful tool that my coworkers can use.
2. I want to become competent with the command line.
3. I want to be able to use Git in the command line to populate this repository and pull from it.

You're welcome to nose around in this repository...it is public, after all.  But please be kind.  I really am just a beginner, so I fully expect the whole thing to be a sloppy mess.  We all have to start somewhere, right?#CSES-7960
